This repository contains a collection of packages used by Top Hat to enforce our commitlint convention and use it to automatically generate changelogs.

## Usage

All packages are published to npm, however if using Yarn Berry, it is possible to install a package directly from git. This is useful for debugging.

```sh
yarn add -D @tophat/commitizen-adapter@tophat/commit-utils#workspace=@tophat/commitizen-adapter
yarn add -D @tophat/commit-utils-core@tophat/commit-utils#workspace=@tophat/commit-utils-core
yarn add -D @tophat/commitlint-config@tophat/commit-utils#workspace=@tophat/commitlint-config
yarn add -D @tophat/conventional-changelog-config@tophat/commit-utils#workspace=@tophat/conventional-changelog-config
```

## Packages

The following packages are provided:

[@tophat/commitlint-config](https://github.com/tophat/commit-utils/tree/main/packages/commitlint-config): A config for commitlint that enforces Top Hat's style guide

[@tophat/commitizen-adapter](https://github.com/tophat/commit-utils/tree/main/packages/commitizen-adapter): An adapter for commitizen that helps you interactively build semantic commit messages

[@tophat/conventional-changelog-config](https://github.com/tophat/commit-utils/tree/main/packages/conventional-changelog-config): A preset for conventional-changelog built on Top Hat's style guide

[@tophat/commit-utils-core](https://github.com/tophat/commit-utils/tree/main/packages/commit-utils-core): A package containing code that is shared between all our config packages. This package is meant for *internal use* only.


## Commit Convention

Top Hat uses the following commit types as part of our development flow. Note that some of the commit types are automatically added to the changelog using [@tophat/conventional-changelog-config](https://github.com/tophat/commit-utils/tree/main/packages/conventional-changelog-config)

<table>
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th>Commit Type</th>
         <th>Title</th>
         <th>Description</th>
         <th>Added to changelog?</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>wip</td>

### Making changes to the config

This configuration specified in these packages are for Top Hat's open source and internal use, so we generally won't be accepting external contributions.

If you are an external contributor and you have changes that you really feel should be included in our global config, feel free to make a suggestion, but please don't take it personally if we decide not to adopt the rule.
These configs are really easy to extend, so feel free to do exactly that with this one and make your own based off of it!
You can learn more from the commitlint docs for [creating shareable configs](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs).

## Contributing to Commit Utils

### Getting Started

Optionally install nvm to ensure you're using the correct version of node. You can find the node version in the `.nvmrc` file. Once you have the right version of node selected, you'll want to enable [corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) via `corepack enable`.

Install dependencies.

```sh
yarn
```

This project uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Yarn Berry](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### Linting

TypeScript is linted with ESLint.


To run ESLint:

```sh
yarn lint
yarn lint:fix
```

### Build

You can execute `yarn build` to generate the build assets that ultimately gets uploaded to the NPM registry. It will also leave the intermediate `lib` artifacts, which contain the transpiled code.
